# What's this?
This is my attempt to solve the Advent of Code 2020 first puzzle (and likely no more than that) using x64 assembly.

I'm doing this to brush up on assembly with something that's a little more than a trivial project,
but still reasonably doable.

## How to build & run
Build by invoking `make`.

Run with `aoc1 < input.txt` where `input.txt` is the input file from the challenge.

Clean by invoking `make clean`.
